<b>HPC Systems Officer</b> at European Spallation Source</br>
<i> March 2017 onwards</i> </br>
Working on developing and supporting the data center which will store and reduce the data produced by the (currently in construction) neutron source in Lund, Sweden.

<ul> <li> Support the HPC cluster environment through configuring/compiling required software, setting up HPC equipment and general troubleshooting of issues that arise.
    <li> Provide first and second line support for cluster users
    <li> Collaborate with developers from other groups within my division to set their software up into production
    <li> Part of team responsible for developing and managing devops systems that deploy systems configuration for the cluster and production systems

<b>Trainee Software Developer</b> on STFC Graduate Scheme (BCS Accredited) </br>
<i>Sept 2014 - Sept 2016</i></br>
Working as a Graduate within STFC, I completed a number of rotations within the organisation that ranged from scientific data analysis to drivers for control hardware. 
<ul> <li> Maintained Autoreduction, a data analysis pipeline webapp responsible for performing data reduction on neutron scattering runs once they had finished. Used Python/Django framework, ActiveMQ messenger service and Javascript frontend
    <li> Worked on Potentiostat driver to use it within <a title="EPICS framework" href="https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/">EPICS</a> using C++
    <li> Improved the European Spallation Source's Live Data Prototype, a data analysis pipeline which allowed users to dynamically interact with the data, and change the parameters as the data was being reduced. Used Python and ZeroMQ messenger service, and required OpenMPI for effective parallel processing
    <li> Set up Quattor configuration management system for ISIS Instrument Analysis machines. Used Pan scripting to automate installation of features, working in RHEL7  
    </ul>
